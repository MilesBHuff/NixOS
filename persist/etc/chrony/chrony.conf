## man 5 chrony.conf

## If possible, you should set up an NTP server on your local intranet, and have all devices connect to that -- this can considerably reduce the load placed on public NTP servers.
## The servers listed in this file are sampled together, and chrony calculates a most-likely weighted average or so from them.
## You can add `prefer` to servers if you want.  You don't really need to in most cases though, since chrony already prefers lower-ping and lower-stratum servers.
## You should generally avoid connecting to stratum-1 servers without permission.
## You should have at *least* 4 different timeservers if you want chrony to be able to accurately and reliably identify outliers.  Note that having too many is also bad, though.
## I try to prefer the servers of long-lasting organizations over those of individuals.
## I would rather use only servers from my own country (the USA), but there is presently a paucity of NTPSec servers out there.
## Do not mix leap-smearing servers (like time.google.com) with normal servers.

## Netnod, a Swedish non-profit that runs many stratum-1 servers in Sweden and graciously allows anyone in the World to get NTP from them.  Amazingly, every server in this list is its own separate stratum-1 server.

## Performance
## Keep chronyd from swapping out of memory
lock_all

## Reliability
## Skip checking certificate times on the first clock update, in case the system's starting time is very wrong.  This should virtually ensure that we never end-up in a situation where we are unable to synchronize time, which is a significant win.  The downside is that our first connection might be compromised; but 99.99% of the time it will still be more-secure than unencrypted NTP.

## RTC Updates
## Overwrite RTC only if it goes above a difference threshold.
rtcautotrim 1
## Allow the system clock to be stepped in the first four updates (which matches how many tries a burst does) if its offset is larger than 0.1 seconds (fast-enough that it shouldn't really be noticeable to users)
makestep 0.1 4

## Timezones
## Whether the RTC is UTC (It should be unless you're dual-booting Windows, in which case you should tell Windows that RTC is UTC, and also disable time syncing in Windows.)
rtconutc
## Make chrony use POSIX time, ignoring leap seconds. (This is needed to avoid app breakage.)
leapsectz UTC
